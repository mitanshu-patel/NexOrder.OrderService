# NexOrder.OrderService

NexOrder.OrderService is a backend microservice responsible for **order creation, order lifecycle management, and coordination between products and users** in the NexOrder system.

It is built using **Azure Functions**, follows **Clean Architecture principles**, and communicates with other services using **Azure Service Bus**.

---

## 🧱 Overview

NexOrder.OrderService is responsible for **order management** within the NexOrder ecosystem. It manages orders and product stocks.

The service intentionally keeps business functionality simple (CRUD) while demonstrating **real-world backend architecture, cloud-native patterns, security, CI/CD, and messaging**.

---

## 🧩 Key Concepts Demonstrated

- Clean Architecture (Domain / Application / Infrastructure)
- Azure Functions (serverless microservice)
- MediatR (CQRS-style command/query separation)
- Entity Framework Core
- Azure SQL Database
- Azure API Management (API Gateway)
- JWT-based authentication (validated at API-M)
- **Azure Service Bus (event-driven messaging)**
- GitHub Actions CI/CD
- Cloud-ready configuration & secrets handling
- **Docker + containerized deployments**

## 🚀 Features

- Create, update, and query orders
- Create, update, and query product stocks
- Clean separation of concerns across layers
- Designed for scalability and extensibility
- Secured behind Azure API Management
- Event publication for downstream services
- Runs locally via **Azure Functions Core Tools** or **Docker**

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **.NET 8**
- **Azure Functions**
- **Entity Framework Core**
- **MediatR**
- **Azure SQL**
- **Azure API Management**
- **Azure Service Bus**
- **Docker / Docker Compose**
- **GitHub Actions**

## 🚌 Messaging & Eventing (Azure Service Bus)

### Incoming Events

- **Topic:** `productserviceevents`
- **Subscription:** `productserviceorder`

Used to react to product updates that may affect order processing.

- **Topic:** `userserviceevents`
- **Subscription:** `userserviceorder`

Used to react to user updates that may affect order processing.

Event contracts are defined in:

```
NexOrder.OrderService.Messages
```

### 🧾 Message Contracts

```
NexOrder.OrderService.Messages
└── ProductEvents
  └── ProductUpdated
└── UserEvents
  └── UserUpdated
```

Benefits:

- Strongly typed event contracts
- Clear ownership of integration boundaries
- Easy versioning and reuse across services

### 🧠 Message Subscribe Handling

- Two Service Bus triggered Azure Functions handle inbound events:
    - `ProductServiceFunctions`
    - `UserServiceFunctions`

## Private Nuget Packages

This project depends on the **NexOrder.Framework** package, which is hosted via GitHub Packages. To successfully build the project in a GitHub Actions environment, the workflow must be configured to authenticate with the private NuGet source.

### GitHub Actions Workflow Update

An additional step is required before the `dotnet restore` command to register the private source using the `GITHUB_TOKEN`.

Add the following step to your `.github/workflows/main_nexorderorderservice.yml` file:

```yaml
- name: Add Private NuGet Source
  run: |
    dotnet nuget add source "[https://nuget.pkg.github.com/mitanshu-patel/index.json](https://nuget.pkg.github.com/mitanshu-patel/index.json)" \
      --name "github" \
      --username "${{ github.actor }}" \
      --password "${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}" \
      --store-password-in-clear-text

- name: Restore dependencies
  run: dotnet restore
```

### Local Development

For local development, developer will need add new Nuget source with the url of index.json as mentioned above and use PAT(Personal Access Token) created via Developer settings, for more refer ```Readme.md``` of **NexOrder.Framework**.

---

## ⚙️ Local Development (without Docker)

### Prerequisites

- .NET SDK 8+
- Azure Functions Core Tools
- SQL Server (local or Azure)
- `dotnet-ef` CLI

### Restore Dependencies

```bash
dotnet restore
```

### ⚙️ Application Configuration

#### appsettings.json

```json
{
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "SystemDbConnectionString": "<Azure SQL Connection String>",
    "ServiceBusConnectionString": "<Azure Service Bus Connection String>"
  }
}
```

### Apply EF Core Migrations

```bash
dotnet ef database update \
  --project NexOrder.OrderService.Infrastructure \
  --startup-project NexOrder.OrderService.Infrastructure
```

### Run Locally

```bash
func start
```

---

## 🐳 Docker Support

Similar to other NexOrder services, this service supports running locally and deploying via containers.

### Prerequisites

- Docker Desktop (or Docker Engine)
- Docker Compose v2

### 🧱 Dockerfile

A `Dockerfile` is included to build a container image for the service.

Build an image locally:

```bash
docker build -t nexorder-orderservice:local .
```

Run the container (example):

```bash
docker run --rm -p 8080:80 \
  -e ConnectionStrings__SystemDbConnectionString="<connection-string>" \
  -e ConnectionStrings__ServiceBusConnectionString="<servicebus-connection-string>" \
  nexorder-orderservice:local
```

> Note: Actual port bindings and hosting settings depend on how the Function host is configured in the container.
> 

### 🧩 Docker Compose

A `docker-compose.yml` is included to simplify local orchestration.

Start services:

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

Stop services:

```bash
docker compose down
```

### 🔐 Configuration in Containers

For local containers, prefer **environment variables** (or a local `.env` file referenced by Compose) rather than committing secrets.

Common keys:

- `ConnectionStrings__SystemDbConnectionString`
- `ConnectionStrings__ServiceBusConnectionString`

---

## 🚢 Deployment

### GitHub Actions

The service supports two deployment workflows using **GitHub Actions** with Azure:

1. **Standard deployment (without containerization)** — builds and deploys the Function App directly
2. **Containerized deployment** — builds a Docker image, pushes to Azure Container Registry, and deploys to Azure Web App for Containers

> **Currently, only the containerized deployment workflow is enabled.**
> 

### Standard Deployment Workflow (Disabled)

When enabled, this workflow:

- Builds & restores the .NET project
- Applies EF Core migrations (controlled pipeline step)
- Deploys directly to Azure Functions

> API Management instances are recreated on demand for cost optimization in non-production environments.
> 

### 🧊 Containerized Deployment Workflow (Active)

This service is deployed as a container to **Azure Web App for Containers**.

High-level flow:

1. Build the Docker image via GitHub Actions
2. Push image to **Azure Container Registry**
3. Configure Azure Web App for Containers to pull and run the image
4. Provide required configuration via **App Settings** (environment variables)

Recommended App Settings (examples):

- `ConnectionStrings__SystemDbConnectionString`
- `ConnectionStrings__ServiceBusConnectionString`
- Any other runtime configuration used by the Function host

---

## 🔐 Security & Authentication

- Authentication is handled by a dedicated **Auth Service**
- JWT tokens are validated at **Azure API Management**
- Order Service assumes authenticated requests from API-M
- No authentication logic is embedded inside the microservice

---

## 🌐 API Management Integration

- API is added to API Management by referencing the deployed Azure Function App.
- Inbound policy includes CORS configuration.
- `validate-jwt` inbound policy enforced.
- API Management becomes the only entry point for clients consuming this service.

---

## API Endpoints (Sample)

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| POST | /product-stocks/search | Search product stocks |
| GET | /product-stocks/{id} | Get product stock details by ID |
| POST | /product-stocks | Create new product stock |
| PUT | /product-stocks/{id} | Update existing product stock details |
| POST | /orders/search | Search orders |
| GET | /orders/{id} | Get order details by ID |
| POST | /orders | Create new order |
| PUT | /orders/{id}/status | Update order status |

## 📌 Notes

- Business functionality is intentionally minimal.
- Focus is on architecture, cloud integration, and scalability.
- Designed to be consumed by any frontend or service.
